--- abstract

This document describes the architecture and requirements for the
Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.  MLS provides a security
layer for group messaging applications with from two to a large number
of clients. It is meant to protect against eavesdropping, tampering,
and message forgery.

# Introduction

End-to-end security is a requirement for instant messaging systems
and is commonly deployed in many such systems. In this context, "end-to-end" captures
the notion that users of the system enjoy some level of security -- with the precise
level depending on the system design -- even when the messaging
service they are using performs unsatisfactorily.

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) specifies an architecture (this document)
and an abstract protocol {{MLSPROTO}} for providing end-to-end security
in this setting. MLS is not intended as a full instant messaging
protocol but rather is intended to be embedded in a concrete protocol
such as XMPP {{?RFC3920}}. In addition, it does not specify a complete
wire encoding, but rather a set of abstract data structures which
can then be mapped onto a variety of concrete encodings, such as
TLS {{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, CBOR {{?RFC7049}}, and JSON {{?RFC7159}}.
Implementations which adopt compatible encodings have some degree of
interoperability at the message level, though they may have incompatible
identity/authentication infrastructures.

This document is intended to describe the overall messaging
system architecture which the MLS protocol fits into, and the
requirements which it is intended to fulfill.

# General Setting

A Group using a Messaging Service (MS) comprises a set of participants
called Members where each Member is typically expected to own multiple
devices, called Clients.  A group may be as small as two members
(the simple case of person to person messaging) or as large as
thousands. In order to communicate securely, Group
Members initially use services at their disposal to obtain the
necessary secrets and credentials required for security.

The Messaging Service (MS) presents as two abstract services that allow
Members to prepare for sending and receiving messages securely:

- An Authentication Service (AS) which is responsible for maintaining
  user long term identities, issuing credentials which allow them to
  authenticate each other, and potentially allowing users to
  discover each others long-term identity keys.

- A Delivery Service (DS) which is responsible for receiving and
  redistributing messages between group members.
  In the case of group messaging, the delivery service may also
  be responsible for acting as a "broadcaster" where the sender sends
  a single message to a group which is then forwarded to each
  recipient in the group by the DS. The DS is also responsible for storing and
  delivering initial public key material required in order to proceed
  with the group secret key establishment process.

In many systems, the AS and the DS are actually operated by the
same entity and may even be the same server. However, they
are logically distinct and, in other systems, may be operated
by different entities, hence we show them as being separate here. Other
partitions are also possible, such as having a separate directory
server.

A typical group messaging scenario might look like this:

1. Alice, Bob and Charlie create accounts with a messaging
   service and obtain credentials from the AS.

2. Alice, Bob and Charlie authenticate to the DS and store
   some initial keying material which can be used to send encrypted messages
   to them for the first time. This keying material is authenticated
   with their long term credentials.

3. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob and Charlie, she
   contacts the DS and looks up their initial keying material.
   She uses these keys to establish a new set of keys which she
   can use to send encrypted messages to Bob and Charlie. She then sends the
   encrypted message(s) to the DS, which forwards them to
   the recipients.

4. Bob and/or Charlie respond to Alice's message. Their messages
   might trigger a new key derivation step which allows the shared group
   key to be updated to provide post-compromise security {{fs-and-pcs}}.

Clients may wish to do the following:

 -  create a group by inviting a set of other members;

 -  add one or more members to an existing group;

 -  remove one or more members from an existing group;

 -  join an existing group;

 -  leave a group;

 -  send a message to everyone in the group;

 -  receive a message from someone in the group.

At the cryptographic level, Clients in groups (and by extension Members)
are peers. For instance, any Client should be able to add a member
to a group. This is in contrast so some designs in which there
is a single group controller who can modify the group. MLS is
compatible with having group administration restricted to
certain users, but we assume that those restrictions are enforced
by authentication and access control. Thus, for instance, while
it might be technically possible for any member to send a message
adding a new member to a group, the group might have the policy
that only certain members are allowed to make changes and thus
other members can ignore or reject such a message from an unauthorized
user.

## Group, Members and Clients

In MLS a Group is defined as a set of Members who possibly use multiple
endpoint devices (Clients) to interact with the Messaging Service.
These Clients will typically correspond to end-user devices such as phones,
web clients or other devices running MLS.

Each member device owns a long term identity key pair that uniquely defines
its identity to other Members of the Group.
Because a single Member may operate multiple devices simultaneously
(e.g., a desktop and a phone) or sequentially (e.g., replacing
one phone with another), the formal definition of a Group in MLS
is the set of Clients that has legitimate knowledge of the shared (Encryption)
Group Key established in the group key establishment phase of the protocol.

In some messaging systems, Clients belonging to the same Member
all share the same identity key pair, but MLS does not assume this.
The MLS architecture considers the more general case and allows for
important use cases, such as a Member adding a new Client when all their
existing clients are offline.

MLS has been designed to provide similar security guarantees to all Clients,
for all group sizes, even when it reduces to only two Clients.

## Authentication Service

The basic function of the Authentication Service is to provide a
trusted mapping from user identities (usernames, phone numbers, etc.),
which exist 1:1 with Members, to identity keys, which may either
be one per Client or may be shared amongst the Clients attached
to a Member.

* A certificate authority or similar service which signs some sort of
  portable credential binding an identity to a key.

* A directory server which provides the key for a given identity
  (presumably this connection is secured via some form of transport
  security such as TLS).

By definition, the AS is invested with a large amount of trust.
A malicious AS can impersonate -- or allow an attacker to impersonate --
any user of the system. This risk can be mitigated by publishing
the binding between identities and keys in a public log such
as Key Transparency (KT) {{KeyTransparency}}. It is possible to build a functional
MLS system without any kind of public key logging, but such a system will
necessarily be somewhat vulnerable to attack by a malicious or untrusted AS.

## Delivery Service

The Delivery Service (DS) is expected to play multiple roles in the
Messaging Service architecture:

* To act as a directory service providing the keying material
  (authentication keys and initial keying material) for Clients to use.
  This allows a Client to establish a shared key
  and send encrypted messages to other Clients even if the
  other Client is offline.

* To route messages between Clients and to act as a message
  broadcaster, taking in one message and forwarding it to multiple Clients
  (also known as "server side fanout")


Depending on the level of trust given by the Group to the Delivery Service,
the functional and security guarantees provided by MLS may differ.

### Key Storage

Upon joining the system, each Client stores its initial cryptographic
key material with the DS. This key material represents the initial contribution
from each member that will be used in the establishment of the shared group
key. This initial keying material MUST be authenticated using
the Client's identity key. Thus, the Client stores:

* A credential from the Authentication service attesting to the
  binding between the Member and the Client's identity key.

* The member's initial keying material signed with the Client's
  identity key.

As noted above, Members may have multiple Clients, each with their
own keying material, and thus there may be multiple entries stored
by each Member.

### Key Retrieval

When a Client wishes to establish a group and send an initial message
to that group, it contacts the DS and retrieves the initial key
material for each other Member, verifies it using the identity key,
and then is able to form a joint key with each other Client, and
from those forms the group key, which it can use for the encryption of
messages.

### Delivery of messages and attachments {#delivery-guarantees}

The DS's main responsibility is to ensure delivery of messages.
Specifically, we assume that DSs provide:

* Reliable delivery: when a message is provided to the DS,
  it is eventually delivered to all group members.

* In-order delivery: messages are delivered to the group
  in the order they are received from a given Client
  and in approximately the order in which they are sent
  by Clients. The latter is an approximate guarantee because
  multiple Clients may send messages at the same time

* Consistent ordering: the DS ensures that all Clients
  have the same view of message ordering.

Note that the DS may provide ordering guarantees by ensuring
in-order delivery or by providing messages with some kind
of sequence information and allowing clients to reorder on
receipt.

The MLS protocol itself should be able to verify these properties.
For instance, if the DS reorders messages from a Client or provides
different Clients with inconsistent orderings, then Clients
should be able to detect this misconduct. However, MLS need
not provide mechanisms to recover from a misbehaving DS.

Note that some forms of DS misbehavior are still possible and
difficult to detect. For instance, a DS can simply refuse
to relay messages to and from a given Client. Without some
sort of side information, other Clients cannot generally
distinguish this form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack
from the Client being actually offline.

### Membership knowledge

Group membership is itself sensitive information and MLS is designed
so that neither the DS nor the AS need have static knowledge
of which Clients are in which Group. However, they may learn
this information through traffic analysis. For instance, in
a server side fanout model, the DS learns that a given Client
is sending the same message to a set of other Clients. In addition,
there may be applications of MLS in which the Group membership
list is stored on some server associated with the MS.


### Membership and offline members

Because Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS)
rely on the deletion and replacement of keying material,
any Client which is persistently offline
may still be holding old keying material and thus be a threat
to both FS and PCS if it is later compromised.
MLS doesn't inherently defend against this problem, but
MLS-using systems should enforce some mechanism for doing
so. Typically this will consist of evicting Clients which
are idle for too long, thus containing the threat of
compromise. The precise details of such mechanisms are
a matter of local policy.



# System Requirements

## Functional Requirements

MLS is designed as a large scale group messaging protocol and hence aims to
provide performance and safety to its users.  Messaging systems that implement
MLS provide support for conversations involving two or more participants,
and aim to scale to approximately 50,000 clients, typically including many
Members using multiple devices.

### Asynchronous Usage

No operation in MLS should require two distinct users to be online
simultaneously. In particular, clients participating in conversations protected
using MLS can update shared keys, add or remove new members, and
send messages and attachments without waiting for another user's reply.

Messaging systems that implement MLS provide a transport layer for
delivering messages asynchronously and reliably.

### Recovery After State Loss

Conversation participants whose local MLS state is lost or corrupted
need to reinitialize their state and continue participating
in the conversation. This may entail some level of message loss, but
should not result in permanent exclusion from the group.

### Support for Multiple Devices

It is typically expected for Members of the Group to own different devices.

A new device can join the group and will be considered as a new Client by
the protocol. This Client will not gain access to the history even if
it is owned by someone who is already a Member of the Group.
Restoring history is typically not allowed at the protocol level but applications
may elect to provide such a mechanism outside of MLS.

### Extensibility / Pluggability

Messages that don't affect the group state can carry an arbitrary payload with
the purpose of sharing that payload between group members. No assumptions
are made about the format of the payload.

### Privacy

The protocol is designed in a way that limits the server-side (AS and DS)
metadata footprint. The DS only persists data required for the delivery
of messages and avoid Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other
sensitive metadata wherever possible. A Messaging Service provider that has
control over both the AS and the DS, will not be able to correlate encrypted
messages forwarded by the DS, with the initial public keys signed by the AS.

### Federation

The protocol aims to be compatible with federated environments. While this
document does not specify all necessary mechanisms required for federation,
multiple MLS implementations should be able to interoperate and to form
federated systems.


### Compatibility with future versions of MLS

It is important the multiple versions of MLS be able to coexist in the future.
Thus, MLS offers a version negotiation mechanism; this mechanism prevents
version downgrade attacks where an attacker would actively rewrite messages
messages with a lower protocol version than the ones originally offered by
the endpoints. When multiple versions of MLS are available, the negotiation
protocol guarantees that the version agreed upon will be the highest version
supported in common by the group.

## Security Requirements

{::comment}
[[TODO: should these be stated as assertions ("MLS guarantees that...") or
goals ("MLS aims to guarantee that...")?]]
{:/comment}

### Connections between Clients and Servers (one-to-one)

We assume that all transport connections are secured via some transport
layer security mechanism such as TLS {{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}. However,
as noted above, the security of MLS should generally survive compromise
of the transport layer.

### Message Secrecy and Authentication {#message-secrecy-authentication}

The trust establishment step of the MLS protocol is followed by a
conversation protection step where encryption is used by clients to
transmit authenticated messages to other clients through the DS.
This ensures that the DS doesn't have access to the Group's private content.

MLS aims to provide Secrecy, Integrity and Authentication for all messages.

Message Secrecy in the context of MLS means that only intended recipients
(current group members), should be able to read any message sent to the group,
even in the context of an active adversary as described in the threat model.

Message Integrity and Authentication mean that an honest Client should only
accept a message if it was sent by a group member and that one Client
cannot  send a message which other Clients accept as being from another Client.

A corollary to this statement is that the AS
and the DS can't read the content of messages sent between Members as
they are not Members of the Group. MLS is expected to
optionally provide additional protections regarding traffic analysis so as to reduce the ability of adversaries, or a compromised
member of the messaging system, to deduce the content of the messages
depending on (for example) their size. One of these protections includes
padding messages in order to produce ciphertexts of standard
length. While this protection is highly recommended it is not
mandatory as it can be costly in terms of performance for clients
and the MS.

Message content can be deniable if the signature keys are exchanged over
a deniable channel prior to signing messages.

#### Forward and Post-Compromise Security {#fs-and-pcs}

MLS provides additional protection regarding secrecy of past messages
and future messages. These cryptographic security properties are
Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS).

FS means that access to all encrypted traffic history combined
with an access to all current keying material on clients will not
defeat the secrecy properties of messages older than the oldest key of
the client.
Note that this means that clients have the extremely important role
of deleting appropriate keys as soon as they have been used with
the expected message, otherwise the secrecy of the messages and the
security for MLS is considerably weakened.

PCS means that if a group member is compromised at some time t but
subsequently performs an update at some time t', then all MLS guarantees should
apply to messages sent after time t'. For example, if an adversary learns all
secrets known to Alice at time t, including both Alice's secret keys and all
shared group keys, but Alice performs a key update at time t', then the
adversary should be unable to violate any of the MLS security properties after
time t'.

Both of these properties must be satisfied even against compromised
DSs and ASs.

#### Membership Changes

MLS aims to provide agreement on group membership, meaning that all
group members have agreed on the list of current group members.

Some applications may wish to enforce ACLs to limit addition or removal
of group members, to privileged users. Others may wish to require
authorization from the current group members or a subset thereof.
Regardless, MLS does not allow addition or removal of group members
without informing all other members.

Once a Member is part of a Group, the set of devices controlled by the
member should only be altered by an authorized member of the group.
This authorization could depend on the application: some applications
might want to allow certain other members of the group to add or
remove devices on behalf of another member, while other applications
might want a more strict policy and allow only the owner of the
devices to add or remove them at the potential cost of weaker PCS guarantees.

Members who are removed from a group do not enjoy special privileges:
compromise of a removed group member should not affect the security
of messages sent after their removal.

#### Security of Attachments

The security properties expected for attachments in the MLS protocol are
very similar to the ones expected from messages. The distinction between
messages and attachments stems from the fact that the typical average time
between the download of a message and the one from the attachments
may be different. For many reasons (a typical reason being the lack of
high bandwidth network connectivity), the lifetime of the cryptographic
keys for attachments is usually higher than for messages, hence slightly
weakening the PCS guarantees for attachments.

#### Denial of Service {#denial-of-service}

In general we do not consider Denial of Service (DoS) resistance to be the responsibility
of the protocol. However, it should not be possible for anyone to perform a
trivial Denial of Service (DoS) attack from which it is hard to recover.

#### Deniability

As described in {{client-compromise}}, MLS aims to provide data origin authentication
within a group, such that one group member cannot send a message that appears
to be from another group member. Additionally, it is a requirement of some
services that a recipient be able to prove to the messaging service that a
message was sent by a given Client, in order to report abuse. MLS should support
both of these use cases. In some deployments, these services may be provided
by mechanisms which allow the receiver to prove a message's origin
to a third party (this if often called "non-repudiation"), but it
should also be possible to operate MLS in a "deniable" mode where such
proof is not possible.
[[OPEN ISSUE: Exactly how to supply this is still a protocol question.]]


# Security Considerations

MLS adopts the Internet threat model {{?RFC3552}} and therefore assumes
that the attacker has complete control of the network. It is intended
to provide the security services described in in the face of such attackers.
In addition,
these guarantees are intended to degrade gracefully in the presence
of compromise of the transport security links as well as of
both Clients and elements of the messaging
system, as described in the remainder of this section.

## Transport Security Links

[TODO: Mostly DoS, message suppression, and leakage of group membership.]


## Delivery Service Compromise

MLS is intended to provide strong guarantees in the face of compromise
of the DS. Even a totally compromised DS should not be able to read
messages or inject messages that will be acceptable to legitimate
Clients. It should also not be able to undetectably remove, reorder
or replay messages.

However, a DS can mount a variety of DoS attacks on the system,
including total DoS attacks (where it simply refuses to forward any
messages) and partial DoS attacks (where it refuses to forward
messages to and from specific Clients). As noted in
{{delivery-guarantees}}, these attacks are only partially detectable
by clients. Ultimately, failure of the DS to provide reasonable
service must be dealt with as a customer service matter, not via
technology.

Because the DS is responsible for providing the initial keying
material to Clients, it can provide stale keys. This doesn't
inherently lead to compromise of the message stream, but does
allow it to attack forward security to a limited extent.
This threat can be mitigated by having initial keys expire.

## Authentication Service Compromise

A compromised AS is a serious matter, as the AS can provide
incorrect or adversarial identities to clients.  As noted in
{{authentication-service}}, mitigating this form of attack requires
some sort of transparency/logging mechanism.  Without such a mechanism,
MLS will only provide limited security against a compromised AS.

## Client Compromise

In general, MLS only provides limited protection against compromised
Clients. When the Client is compromised, then the attacker will
obviously be able to decrypt any messages for groups in which the
Client is a member. It will also be able to send messages
impersonating the compromised Client until the Client updates its
keying material (see {{fs-and-pcs}}).
MLS attempts to provide some security in the face of client
compromise.

In addition, a Client should not be able to send a message to
a group which appears to be from another Client with a different
identity. Note that if Clients from the same Member share keying material,
then one will be able to impersonate another.

Finally, Clients should not be able to perform denial of
service attacks {{denial-of-service}}.
